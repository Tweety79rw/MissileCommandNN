# MissileCommandNN
This is a clone of [MissileCommand](https://github.com/Tweety79rw/missileCommand) using a neural network for the enemy missiles.

The neural network is from coding train and can be found [here](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Toy-Neural-Network-JS).

This uses p5.js to render the canvas.
